##Memory Match Game

This JavaScript memory game consists of a grid of cards, each hiding one of several pairs of colors. The game logic involves the following steps:

Card Initialization: Cards are randomly assigned colors from a predefined set of pairs.
Display Briefly: All cards are shown briefly before being hidden.
Card Click Event: Clicking a card reveals its color. If two consecutive cards match, they remain visible; otherwise, they are hidden again after a short delay.
Game Completion: The game tracks the number of matched pairs. When all pairs are found, the game ends, displaying the time taken to complete.
